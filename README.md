# ToDoList
https://yaswant-kumar-singhi.github.io/ToDoList/

This is a small javascript project where I have made a Todo List Manager using Vanila JS.

## Features

> A minimal design with HTML and CSS.
> A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
> Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
> A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
> A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)

@CN-its ready to work! :shipit:
