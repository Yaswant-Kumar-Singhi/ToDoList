This is a small javascript project where I have made a Todo List Manager using Vanila JS.

## Features

- A minimal design with HTML and CSS.
- A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
- Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
- A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
- A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)
