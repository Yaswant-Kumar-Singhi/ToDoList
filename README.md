# ToDoList
https://yaswant-kumar-singhi.github.io/ToDoList/

This is a small javascript project where I have made a Todo List Manager using Vanila JS.

#Features

1. A minimal design with HTML and CSS.
2. A text box at the top to add a todo item to the list.
3. Add button: when a user clicks on the button, add that todo item to the list.
4. A delete button to delete the todo item completely from the list.
5. A checkbox to check the item off the list. (checked item should stay in the list, with some differentiation from rest of the todo items)
